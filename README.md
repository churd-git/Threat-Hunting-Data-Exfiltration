# Threat Hunt Report: Data Exfiltration 

## Example Scenario:

We are about to initiate an investigation involving a company executive, Bryce Montgomery, at a large tech company. The Risk Department suspects that Mr. Montgomery may be involved in the theft of company intellectual property. The VP of Risk has requested the Security Operations Manager to search for any signs of unusual or unauthorized data access or anything else suspicious. Investigate Bryce Montgomery's computer for any signs of unusual activity or potential data theft.

Important Context:
- Executives' Privileges: Executives, including Bryce Montgomery, have full administrative privileges on their own workstations.
- DLP Exception: While a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution is in place, some executives were made exempt from it due to concerns about productivity and inconvenience.

Known Information:
- Username: bmontgomery
- Workstation: corp-ny-it-0334
